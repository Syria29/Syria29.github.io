## Journalism Beats By Race
Journalism is an important source of information that people of all demographics consume on a regular basis, so it only makes sense to understand who is providing the information that we consume. According to a Pew Research study done in Feb-Mar 2022, people who identify as Caucasian dominate more than 50% of every major news beat. On the other hand, Asian identifying people don't even make up 10% of any of the major beats. This is an issue because it is important for people to hear from minority voices, but if they dominate such a small space within the news work force than how can they be heard?
